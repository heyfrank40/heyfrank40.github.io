			<h2>About this blog (I am pretending to write something down).</h2>
			
			
			<p>
				I'm working on the structure of this blog that currently is pretty simple: the body contains a header, a navigation menu and sections.<br>
				Next steps are:<br>
				
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>to add an aside element</li>
				<li>to fix the CSS file to make it work on different devices</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				By the way, this is a blog that I want to use to improve my english and my technical skills, that's it.<br>
				In this topic you could find all the informations about this blog, from the other topics to the structural changes. Whenever I have free time I'll update this page.<br>
